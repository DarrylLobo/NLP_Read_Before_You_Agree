# NLP_Read_Before_You_Agree

 ## Objective:

This project outlines the concept of a third-party extension or service (henceforth known as the Read Before You Agree, or ‘RBYA’) connected to conventional browsers (such as Google Chrome) to be used in tandem with a consumer signing up for any online-based product or service with an associated ToS agreement. In addition, the RBYA may also be available as a web or app service where consumers can paste their ToS agreements which will help identify punitive and digital privacy clauses that warrant their attention according to user’s preferences, and potentially provide friendlier alternative services.
